The AI engineer successfully built the core NAVHIM Hospital Management System, a cross-platform React Native app. Initial setup involved installing dependencies and integrating Zoom and Razorpay. The backend was fully developed using FastAPI and MongoDB, handling user authentication (JWT), patient/doctor models, and API endpoints, including a seed script for sample data. Several backend issues like import errors and missing packages were debugged and resolved.

Frontend development utilized Expo Router for navigation, with dedicated layouts for authentication, patient, and doctor flows. Key screens like Login, Register, Patient Home, Doctor Home, and Appointment Booking were implemented. The engineer iteratively refined UI elements, addressing user feedback on login/register screen designs, quick actions, appointment date/time selection, and profile logout functionality. Payment integration with Razorpay and appointment confirmation with Zoom links were also implemented. The final action involves debugging a payment processing issue and enhancing the appointment listing and detail views.

<product_requirements>
The NAVHIM Hospital Management System is a cross-platform (Android, iOS, Web) React Native application for hospital management, requiring HIPAA compliance.
Core functionalities include:
1.  **Patient Management System**
2.  **User Access Control & Authentication:** JWT-based email/password login for patients and doctors, with distinct views for each role.
3.  **Patient Portal:** Displays Navhim Card, Book Appointment, Ambulance, Emergency, EMR, Categories, Available Doctors. Quick Actions UI on homepage needs to be fantastic.
4.  **Patient-Facing Online Appointment Booking Portal:** Scheduling via video conferencing (Zoom API). Date and time selection UI must be stunning, preventing past time bookings. Proceed to Payment button (Razorpay integration) leads to a nice confirmation page with the Zoom link.
5.  **Doctor Availability Management:** Comprehensive doctor onboarding (specialty, etc.).
6.  **Appointment Confirmation & Communication:** Confirmation page after booking, Zoom link for appointments.
7.  **Profile Sections:** Logout functionality should be immediate.
The app design should be phenomenal and sexiest, with clean UI (e.g., no padding below sticky navigation, improved Login/Create Account screens).
**Integrations:** Zoom (Tqi4FabXR7-K7JQYBWcBxq, F5j400_1Q7qhCVnH3hBsgA, SRXF4p5gTXeBBZB6yZp0Is2AnaJKFcFF), Razorpay (rzp_test_RXeSV92MQp5Y6G, gGXKUnuvegGDbRLdWedViH9h), JWT for authentication.

<code_architecture>
The application uses a monorepo structure with  (FastAPI) and  (Expo/React Native) directories.



-   ****: The main FastAPI application. It integrates authentication, defines API endpoints for users, doctors, patients, and appointments, handles Razorpay payment processing, and Zoom meeting creation. Was iteratively built and refined.
-   ****: Defines Pydantic and MongoDB ODMantic models for , , , and , establishing the database schema.
-   ****: Contains JWT authentication logic, including token creation, verification, password hashing, and dependency injection for protected routes. Fixed import error.
-   ****: A utility script to populate the MongoDB database with sample doctor data for testing purposes.
-   ****: The root layout for Expo Router, handling global navigation structure and potential authentication checks. Modified to remove explicit  declaration and adjust padding.
-   ****: The initial entry point that redirects users based on their authentication status (patient, doctor, or unauthenticated). Fixed navigation issue ().
-   ****: The user login screen. Significantly improved with gradients, animations, and a new design.
-   ****: The user registration screen. Design improved to match the new login screen.
-   ****: Layout specifically for authentication-related routes, encapsulating  and .
-   ****: Layout for patient-specific screens, likely including bottom tabs.
-   ****: Patient's home dashboard, displaying the NAVHIM card, quick actions, and available doctors. Quick Actions UI was enhanced.
-   ****: Appointment booking flow. Heavily redesigned with  for day/time slot selection, disables past times, includes Razorpay Proceed to Payment button (bug in current state), and improved header.
-   ****: Lists patient's appointments. Design improved and made clickable to show details/video links.
-   ****: Patient profile screen. Logout action made immediate.
-   ****: Appointment confirmation page displaying booking details and the Zoom meeting link.
-   ****: Layout for doctor-specific screens.
-   ****: Doctor onboarding screen to collect specialized information like .
-   ****: Doctor profile screen. Logout action made immediate.
-   ****: Centralized service for making API requests to the backend.
-   ****: Handles authentication-related API calls and token management.
-   ****: Zustand store for managing global authentication state (, , ).

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing two user-reported issues:
1.  **Payment Button Bug:** The Proceed to Payment button in the  screen was stuck in a rotating state, failing to initiate the Razorpay payment process.
2.  **Appointments Tab Design & Functionality:** The user requested an improvement in the design of the My appointments tab and explicitly asked for appointments to be clickable, leading to a screen showing video links and all relevant appointment details.

The engineer's last actions (Chat Message 148 and 149) indicate that  and  were edited to address these issues. The engineer also stated an intention to create a dedicated appointment details screen, which is likely part of making the appointments clickable and fully functional.
